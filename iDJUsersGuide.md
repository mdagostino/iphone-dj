# iDJ User's Guide #

This page is intended as instructions both to users (how to use) and developers (how to implement).


## Loading and playing of MP3 songs ##

  * Double-tap the disc to open your iPod directory list.
  * Click the song.
  * The song is loaded, and you return to the main view.

## Cross-fader ##

The Cross-fader is used to mix between songs.

  * The cross-fader is the big slider control in the bottom of the screen.
  * Pull the slider to the far left to only hear Disc 1, pull it to the far right to only hear Disc 2.
  * When the slider is in the middle, both Disc 1 and 2 are played with equal volume.


## Forward/reverse (in-song navigation) ##

You navigate a song by rotating the records.

  * Press a finger on one of the discs.
  * Drag the finger clockwise to move forward in the song.
  * Drag the finger counter-clockwise to move back in the song.
  * Release the disc to let it resume playing.


## Pitch/speed control ##

You can change the pitch/speed either by touching the discs, or with the slider control for more precise changes.

### Temporary speed change by touching the discs ###

  * Place a finger on one of the spinning discs to slow it down to a halt.
  * Move the finger on the disc clockwise to play the song. The quicker you move the finger around, the higher pitch.
  * Let go of the finger to let the disc resume its original speed.

### Permanent speed change with slider controls ###

  * The pitch controls are located in the middle of each of the discs.
  * Press the finger against a pitch control, and it will grow larger for more precise adjustments.
  * Move the slider upwards for higher speed/pitch. Move the slider downwards for lower speed/pitch.
  * Let go of the control, and it will shrink to its original size. The speed will remain at the level you set it.

### "English Spin" ###

  * Put down two fingers near the center of the disc, and rotate.
  * The disc will quickly gain speed.
  * After a while, the disc will revert back to its original speed.

## Scratching ##

  * Put down a finger on a disc, and move it back/forth (clockwise/counter-clockwise).
  * The song will be played quickly reverse/forward, emitting a scratching sound.

## Volume control ##

Each deck/disc plays in a separate channels with its own volume control. In addition to that, the iPhone volume control (side buttons) serves as the master volume control for both channels.

Changing volume on one of the channels:
  * The channel volume slider is located above the corresponding disc.
  * Move the slider to the right to increase the volume, move it to the left to decrease (and eventually mute completely) the volume.
